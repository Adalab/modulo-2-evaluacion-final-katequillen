# Modulo 2 Evaluaci√≥n Final
Hey! Welcome to the ADALAB Module 2 final exam! The assignment: to develop a webpage with which to search for TV series and which allows the user to save the series that they like the most.

The finished webpage consists of a search box into which the user can type the name or part of the name of the series that they are looking for, and which returns a new search selection on each key up. The information returned from the API can be found to the right of the page, and there is a section to the left called 'My Favorite Series,' which displays the items selected by the user as favorites.

This webpage is built with JavaScript, includes basic HTML structure and SCSS styles, and uses information from the tvmaze.com API (http://api.tvmaze.com).
